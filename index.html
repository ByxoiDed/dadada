							As King Grey, Arthur had pale, short blonde hair.
							He had a large build from extensive training and was seen wearing a pale, yellow robe or tunic with long white pants that end just before his calves paired with brown sandals.
							During times of war, Grey is seen in a full-body armor suit.
							Born as Arthur Leywin, Arthur had short auburn brown hair and large bright azure eyes. He had a small round face and was generally dressed in solid-colored fabrics by his mother.
							As he grew older, Arthur's hair started to grow longer, with short bangs sweeping across his forehead. At the age of eight, Arthur had grown taller and his hair had grown significantly, extending just past his ears, above his neck.
							Once he had returned from Elenoir to Xyrus City in Sapin, Arthur had a hair cut which left him having short hair with long bangs that sweep across his forehead.

							He wears a loose, pale, argyle shirt beneath a hooded, navy blue jacket with grey markings across the sleeves. His face is covered with a white, full-face mask with a blue half note printed alongside his left eye hole.
							Arthur wears black, spiked aurochs skinned, fingerless gloves with three green, single-use healing spell gems embedded on the knuckles.
